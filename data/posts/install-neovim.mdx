# Install Neovim

If you like Vim, you will love NeoVim. NeoVim is the future with modern GUIs. It uses Lua and
vimscript to help you make modifications to your config file.

## MacOs

1. Check If you have installed Homebrew in your system

```

run this code: brew --version

```

2. If it doesn't display a man pages, then you need to install Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

3. Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```

brew install neovim

```

4. You are done, check If it is installed:

```

nvim --version

```

## Linux

### Many distros, many ways to install it.

### Arch Linux

You need to have installed pacman in your system.

```

sudo pacman -S neovim

```

### Debian

```

sudo apt-get install neovim

```

### Fedora

```

sudo dnf install -y neovim python3-neovim

```

### Ubutun

```

sudo apt install neovim

```

Once installed, I would suggest you to go this two github repositories:

1. [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad)

2. [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim)

Those two repositories attempt to give you the best experience with default plugins already 
installed. I personally use NvChad for my Macbook Air but for my Desk I use my own congifuration.

Thank you for your time and be blazing fast with NeoVim.
